<h2>📖 Introduction</h2>
<p>
This project focuses on building a robust <b>Image Classification model for Animals</b> using <b>Deep Learning</b> techniques. The system can automatically recognize and classify various animal species from raw image data, making it useful for educational apps, wildlife monitoring systems, or biodiversity tracking platforms.
</p>

<p>
The classification model is powered by a <b>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</b>, trained on a labeled image dataset consisting of different animal categories. Through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, the system achieves high accuracy in recognizing species from unseen images.
</p>

<p>
The objective is to develop a <b>scalable, efficient, and accurate image classification pipeline</b> that can serve as the backbone of real-world applications involving image recognition in the animal domain.
