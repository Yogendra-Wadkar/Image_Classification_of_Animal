## üìñ Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a robust image classification model that can automatically identify animals in pictures and classify them into predefined categories. Deep learning, especially CNNs, has proven effective in extracting image features and enabling accurate classification.

## üß© Problem Statement

In many wildlife, educational, and ecological contexts, recognizing animal species from images is crucial. Manual classification is time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to automate the process using CNNs trained on labeled animal images.

## üìÇ Dataset Description

- Contains multiple folders representing different animal classes (e.g., cats, dogs, horses, lions, etc.).
- Each folder includes multiple RGB images of that animal.
- The dataset is preprocessed using resizing and normalization techniques.

## üîÅ Project Pipeline

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Animal image dataset organized by class.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Image resizing (e.g., 128x128).
- Normalization to scale pixel values between 0 and 1.
- Splitting into training and validation sets.

### 3. **Model Building**
- CNN model using `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling`, `Flatten`, and `Dense` layers.
- Applied `Dropout` to prevent overfitting.

### 4. **Model Compilation**
- Loss Function: `categorical_crossentropy`
- Optimizer: `Adam`
- Evaluation Metric: `accuracy`

### 5. **Model Training**
- Trained over multiple epochs with validation.
- Used `EarlyStopping` and `ModelCheckpoint`.

### 6. **Model Evaluation**
- Checked accuracy, loss curves.
- Evaluated precision, recall, F1-score.
- Confusion matrix plotted.

### 7. **Predictions**
- Tested the model with unseen animal images.
- Model predicted the correct class with high accuracy.

## üèÅ Conclusion

This project demonstrated how CNNs can be leveraged for high-performance image classification tasks. By using image preprocessing, a well-designed architecture, and proper tuning, the model achieved impressive results. It can serve as the foundation for more complex systems like wildlife detection cameras, animal tracking software, or educational tools.
